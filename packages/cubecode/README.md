# CubeCode

> Store data on Rubik's cubes.

CubeCode is a proof-of-concept method of storing data in Rubik's cubes, enabled by a one-to-one mapping of every single possible Rubik's cube state to an integer between $0$ and $43,252,003,274,489,856,000 - 1$.

This enables interesting functionality like being able to share a state of a cube with just a (relatively) short number, being able to store a secret message with ASCII on a single 3x3, and even being able to store larger pieces of data on multiple 3x3s.

## Watch How it was Made

> Do you think you know Rubik's cubes well? Up for a challenge? **Decode** the Rubik's cube shown in the video at the start and put it into the [Secret Page](https://cubecode.vercel.app/secret) to unlock a secret message from me!

A basic overview of CubeCode and some interesting usecases are documented in the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ZStTs914k). Check it out!

## Try it Out

You can try CubeCode's functionality right now with the demo at [cubecode.vercel.app](https://cubecode.vercel.app), which allows you to store secret messages in Rubik's cubes with CubeCode.
